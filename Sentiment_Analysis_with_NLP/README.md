# Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing

This folder contains the workspace for the course project. The main file is 

[project_5_starter.ipynb](https://github.com/jegali/AI_for_Trading/blob/main/Sentiment_Analysis_with_NLP/project_5_starter.ipynb)

so you might want to have a look at this. <br/>
If you want to read the project review by udacity, read this file:

[Project review](https://github.com/jegali/AI_for_Trading/blob/main/Sentiment_Analysis_with_NLP/project_review.md)

The project folder contains a CSV file with the data to analyse. This file is 1.37GB in size, so I decided not do download and place it in this repository.
