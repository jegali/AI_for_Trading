# AI for Trading

This repository contains detailed notes and multiple projects implemented in Python for the "AI for Healthcare"-Nanodegree of Udacity.

## Course 1: Basic Quantitative Trading

In this course, you will learn about market mechanics and how to generate signals with stocks. Your first project is to develop a momentum trading strategy.

In the project, you will learn to implement a momentum trading strategy and test if it has the potential to be profitable. You will work with historical data of a given stock universe and generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. You will then compute the signal and produce projected returns. Finally, you will perform a statistical test to conclude if there is alpha in the signal.

## Course 2: Advanced Quantitative Trading

In this course, you will get to know the workflow that a quant follows for signal generation, and also learn to apply advanced quantitative methods in trading.

In the project, you will code and evaluate a breakout signal. You will run statistical tests to test for normality and to find alpha. You will also learn to find outliers and evaluate the effect that filtered outliers could have on your trading signal. You will run various scenarios of your model with or without the outliers and decide if the outliers should be kept or not.
