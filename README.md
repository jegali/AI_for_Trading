# AI for Trading

This repository contains detailed notes and multiple projects implemented in Python for the "AI for Trading"-Nanodegree of Udacity.
<br/><br/>

## Course 1: Basic Quantitative Trading

In this course, you will learn about market mechanics and how to generate signals with stocks. Your first project is to develop a momentum trading strategy.

In the project, you will learn to implement a momentum trading strategy and test if it has the potential to be profitable. You will work with historical data of a given stock universe and generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. You will then compute the signal and produce projected returns. Finally, you will perform a statistical test to conclude if there is alpha in the signal.

## Course 2: Advanced Quantitative Trading

In this course, you will get to know the workflow that a quant follows for signal generation, and also learn to apply advanced quantitative methods in trading.

In the project, you will code and evaluate a breakout signal. You will run statistical tests to test for normality and to find alpha. You will also learn to find outliers and evaluate the effect that filtered outliers could have on your trading signal. You will run various scenarios of your model with or without the outliers and decide if the outliers should be kept or not.

## Course 3: Stocks, Indices, and ETFs

In this course, you will learn about portfolio optimization, and financial securities formed by stocks such as market indices, vanilla ETFs, and Smart Beta ETFs.

In the project, you will create two portfolios utilizing smart beta methodology and optimization. You will evaluate the performance of the portfolios by calculating tracking errors. You will also calculate the turnover of your portfolio and find the best timing to rebalance. You will come up with the portfolio weights by analyzing fundamental
data, and by quadratic programming.

<br/><br/>


## Course 4: Factor Investing and Alpha Research

In this course, you will learn about alpha factors and risk factors, and construct a portfolio with advanced portfolio optimization techniques.

In the project, you will research and generate multiple alpha factors. Then you will apply various techniques to evaluate the performance of your alpha factors and learn to pick the best ones for your portfolio. You will formulate an advanced portfolio optimization problem by working with constraints such as risk models, leverage, market neutrality and limits on factor exposures.

## Course 5: Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing

In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of text processing and use them to analyze corporate filings and generate sentiment-based trading signals.

In the project, you will apply Natural Language Processing on corporate filings, such as 10Q and 10K statements, from cleaning data and text processing, to feature extraction and modeling. You will utilize bag-of-words and TF-IDF to generate company-specific sentiments. Based on the sentiments, you will decide which company to invest in, and the optimal time to buy or sell.

<br/><br/>


## Course 6: Advanced Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

In this course, you will get to know how deep learning is applied in quantitative analysis and get to use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) to generate trading signals.

In the project, you will build deep neural networks to process and interpret news data. You will also play with different ways of embedding words into vectors. You will construct and train LSTM networks for sentiment classification. You will run backtests and apply the models to news data for signal generation.

## Course 7: Combining Multiple Signals

In this course, you will learn about advanced techniques to select and combine the factors that you’ve generated from both alternative data and market data.

In this project, you’ll combine signals on a random forest for enhanced alpha. While implementing this, you’ll have to solve the problem of overlapping samples. For the dataset, we’ll be using the end of day from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.

## Course 8: Simulating Trades with Historical Data

In this course, you will build a fairly realistic backtester that uses the Barra data. The backtester will perform portfolio optimization that includes transaction costs, and you’ll implement it with computational efficiency in mind, to allow for a reasonably fast backtest. You’ll also use performance attribution to identify the major drivers of your portfolio’s profit-and-loss (PnL). You will have the option to modify and customize the backtest as well.
