# Smart Beta Portfolio and Portfolio Optimization

This is the project review I got for the project "Smart Beta Portfolio and Portfolio Optimization" in the "AI for trading" nanodegree


## Meets Specifications

# Excellent work

Your code is excellent and you have clearly demonstrated your understanding of the project.  
Excellent work working with  `cvxpy`  to write the function that performs optimization!  
It was a pleasure reviewing your work, and we look forward to seeing future submissions from you.

## Congratulations and Keep up the good work

	Excellent work calculating the dollar-volume, and appropriately normalizing each value by  
the sum total dollar-volume traded for these stocks each day

- [x]  The function  `calculate_dividend_weights`  computes dividend weights.

	Nice job calculating the weights for the dividend ETF based on cumulative dividends.

- [x]  The function  `generate_returns`  computes returns.

	Nice job calculating returns.

- [x]  The function  `generate_weighted_returns`  computes weighted returns.

	Nice work calculating the weighted returns.

- [x]  The function  `calculate_cumulative_returns`  computes cumulative returns.

	Nice job calculating the cumulative returns.

- [x]  The function  `tracking_error`  computes tracking error.

	Great job calculating the tracking error!

## Part 2: Portfolio Optimization

- [x]  The function  `get_covariance_returns`  computes covariance of the returns.

	Excellent work calculating the covariance.

- [x]  The function  `get_optimal_weights`  computes optimal weights.
